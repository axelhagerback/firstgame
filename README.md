# firstgame

This is my first game!

You play as dude and move around the course using the platforms.
The objective of the game is to collect the leaks and avoid the bombs that spawn.
When you collect all the leaks they respawn and also spawn a new bomb.
Get the highest score possible!

You controll the character by using the arrow keys:
*press right to go right
*press left to go left
*press the up key to jump

The game was made using JavaScript and the framework Phaser.
